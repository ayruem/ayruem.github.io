  <h3>Reinhardt</h3>
  <h4>THE tank</h4>
  <p><b>Reinhardt</b> Wilhelm is your team's most important member. He wields his powerful Rocket Hammer and carries a strong Shield Barrier. At the frontlines you can clear the 
  way forward and hold the line for your team. His Fire Strike allows extra damage to be sent off from a distance. His most unique ability is his Charge. A succesful charge allows you to pin
  your target and carry them away from their team. While pinned you can crush your target between a wall and yourself. Finally, your ultimate Earthshatter sends out a cone-shaped earthquake knocking down 
  any targets in its path.</p>
