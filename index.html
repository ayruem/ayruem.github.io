    <h1>Hello World - 2 January 2018</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages. I am tool that follows tutorials to the letter.
	<br />Also hi Fernando, Justin, and Chris.</p>
    <ol>Things I want to learn.
      <li>How to make a website</li>
      <li>Computer science</li>
      <li>HTML and CSS, but like really <em>really</em> good</li>
      <li>Science</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>Things I like
      <li>MYSELF</li>
      <li>Using markup I already know</li>
      <li>Learnding from mistakes</li>
      <li>Running</li>
    <h2>Why does this exist?<h2>
    <p>I'm on and around computers at all times essentially. I can use a computer, I can use my phone, and I can use the internet.
	However, I don't know <strong>how</strong> they work. It has been increasingly gnawing at my brain that such a major facet of not simply
	my life but of everybody's everyday life is completely unknown to me. So this site is me haphazardly scratching a specific  but unknown itch.</p>
	<p>Getting HTML down isn't what I want but for today its satisfying the itch. A bit. I have a vague idea of what, in the end, I want from this. I know
	a few of things I want along the way.
	<dl>General Goals and Ideas for the site.
	  <dt>1. Make this website visitable</dt>
	  <dd>Even if its not the most eye catching thing to look at a visitor should be able to browse a bit and get something. So... content.</dd>
	  <dt>2. Make this website bearable to look at.</dt>
	  <dd>Black on white is great contrast but god awfully boring.
	  <dt>3. Show iterations of the site with additions of new types of markup.
	  <dd>Have different versions of the same page sans CSS or something else crucial.
	  <!-- 3 is the hardest thing to write, even mostly annonymously because it shows how little I understand the words I'm using. -->
	</dl>
	<ul>Things I hope to learn, intentionally or accidentally, along the way.
	  <li>Programming</li>
	  <li>What programming is.</li>
	  <li>Computer science</li>
	  <li>If programming and computer science are different things.</li>
	  <li>Good workflow and documentation skills.</li>
	  <li>Other:Work ethic, commitment, happiness.</li>
